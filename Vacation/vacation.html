                My favorite vacation was going to Chattanooga, TN. 
                My dad and I went down during the summer because he had to go into the office down there.
                I really enjoyed it because I got to do a lot of cool stuff and see some awesome places, which you can read about below.
            </p>
            <p>
                While we were there, we went to lookout mountain and watched the suneset. 
                It also offered a great view of the surrounding area.
                From the top, we could see 3 other states: South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.
                It was such a breathtaking view that I still remember it.
            </p>
            <p>
                What's even cooler about Lookout Mountain is that there is a cave beneath it. 
                Ruby Falls was discovered in 1928, and is one of the more popular attractions in the area.
                The welcome center is this awesome stone structure built from the rock excavated to make the elevator.
                Once you get off the elevator, you go on a little tour to see some of the features of the cave before going to the falls.
                It's quite a cool place because you don't see a waterfall in a cave every day.
                If I ever were to go back, that definetly would be on my list.

                Another place I went in Chattanooga was the Tennessee Aquarium.
                The aquarium was split into two different sections, and we had to choose which section to visit.
                We chose to view the river building, which contained wildlife native to the Tennessee River.
                I got to se a lot of cool animals, such as otters, ducks, turtles, and snakes, on top of all of the different types of fish.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also rented a boat while we were down there to cruise along the Tennessee River.
                I had a really fun time doing that because I grew up going to a lake in Virginia every summer, and the water is such a familiar place to me.
                On one of the islands we saw a bald eagle.
                After a bit of searching, we found its nest, and we waited hoping to see it again, and sadly we didn't.
                On the way bact to the rental place, my dad was showing me one of the nuclear plants he manages projects for, and we unexpectedly saw a snake slithering through the water.
                It was a little freaky.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, my favorite part of the trip was going to the U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama.
                It was such an awesome place to visit, especially with my interest in rockets.
                They had a pathfinder model of the Space Shuttle, which was sadly taken down for maintenance.
                They also had two Saturn V rockets, one of which whas assembled but never flew.
                I was completely nerding out looking at the RS-25 Space Shuttle and F-1 Saturn V engines.

                Overall, it was such a fun trip and I would definetly go again if I could. 
                Chattanooga is a really funlittle city with a bunch of attractions.
                I would recommend any of the attractions that I mentioned, and there are others that I visited that I would recommend as well.
