# Digital Media Web Design

Hello, I am Alex Schoepf and I am in Mr. Vroon's Digital Media Web Design class at Lakeshore High School.

In this repository, I will post all of the code I write. Above you will find some of the projects I wrote. 

If you are in my class, please do not copy my code. It is for reference use ONLY and if I find you using it, I will alert Mr. Vroon.
