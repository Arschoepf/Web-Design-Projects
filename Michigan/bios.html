                    Thomas Alva Edison was an American inventor and businessman who has been described as America's greatest inventor. 
                    He developed many devices in fields such as electric power generation, mass communication, sound recording, and motion pictures. 
                    These inventions, which include the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and early versions of the electric light bulb, have had a widespread impact on the modern industrialized world. 
                    He was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of organized science and teamwork to the process of invention, working with many researchers and employees. 
                    He established the first industrial research laboratory.

                <p>
                    Edison was raised in the American Midwest; early in his career he worked as a telegraph operator, which inspired some of his earliest inventions.
                    In 1876, he established his first laboratory facility in Menlo Park, New Jersey, where many of his early inventions were developed. 
                    He later established a botanic laboratory in Fort Myers, Florida, in collaboration with businessmen Henry Ford and Harvey S. 
                    Firestone, and a laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey, that featured the world's first film studio, the Black Maria. 
                    He was a prolific inventor, holding 1,093 US patents in his name, as well as patents in other countries. 
                    Edison married twice and fathered six children. 
                    He died in 1931 of complications of diabetes.

                    Henry Ford was an American industrialist, business magnate, and founder of the Ford Motor Company, and chief developer of the assembly line technique of mass production. 
                    By creating the first automobile that middle-class Americans could afford, he converted the automobile from an expensive curiosity into an accessible conveyance that profoundly impacted the landscape of the 20th century.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His introduction of the Ford Model T automobile revolutionized transportation and American industry. 
                    As the Ford Motor Company owner, he became one of the richest and best-known people in the world. 
                    He is credited with "Fordism", the mass production of inexpensive goods coupled with high wages for workers. 
                    Ford had a global vision, with consumerism as the key to peace.
                    His intense commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical and business innovations, including a franchise system that put dealerships throughout North America and major cities on six continents. 
                    Ford left most of his vast wealth to the Ford Foundation and arranged for his family to permanently control it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ford was also widely known for his pacifism during the first years of World War I, and for promoting antisemitic content, including The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, through his newspaper The Dearborn Independent, and the book The International Jew.
